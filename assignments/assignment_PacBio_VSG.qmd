## Grading and report

The assignment is scored on 10 points and counts towards 10% of the final grade.

Your report should be a single PDF file that contains your report text, code, and figures in a single doc

## Background

In this assignment you will analyze data from the following paper:

S. Jayaraman *et al.* (2019), [Application of long read sequencing to determine expressed antigen diversity in Trypanosoma brucei infections][1], PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases 13(4): e0007262.

You will need a copy of the paper to answer some of the assignment question.

The paper has an accompanying [Github repository][2] where you will find some useful commands.

## Software

You will need the following software to solve the assignment:

1. **BLAST+**: Install the NCBI command line standalone BLAST+ programs following the [online instructions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/). 
   - On Windows, installation in the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) will be easier than following the above instructions.
   - For Ubuntu (and hence also WSL), there exists a package "ncbi-blast+"  not listed on the NCBI page, which you can install directly using `apt-get install`.

2. **GetORF**: Install the [getorf](https://bio.tools/getorf) tool. The [installation instructions](http://emboss.open-bio.org/html/adm/ch01s01.html) are a bit tedious, but you should get there in the end. Again, on Windows, installation in the WSL will be easier.

3. **Programming language**: You may use any language: Python, Julia, R, ...

4. **Packages** for reading FASTA-formatted files and importing and manipulating DataFrames. Find and install them for your preferred programming language. 

5. **Data analysis and visualization, report writing**: Use [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) (or Jupyter notebooks) and/or an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for data analysis and visualization. Using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) you can integrate your notebooks, data visualization, and final report all in a markdown document. [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) notebooks for Julia offer nice reactive features. 

## Sequence data {#sec-data}

All data for the assignment are available on [UiB OneDrive](https://universityofbergen-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tom_michoel_uib_no/EphdekZYkYBJnqYKRcpoOfsBJBouvZhTOQEorETwKBHGsA?e=roErlx) in the **PacBio VSG** folder. You will need to login with your UiB account to obtain access. You will need the following files:

1. A database of known VSG genes. Download the entire folder **TREU927-v26_VSGTranscripts**.

2. Sequencing data from **one** sample (**one** file) named  **PacBio_VSG_filtered_reads_*sample_name*.fasta**. Twenty such files, for 20 samples (individual mice), are available in total. To find out which one *you* should download:

   1. Go to the **Groups** page on Mitt ([https://mitt.uib.no/courses/42444/groups](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/42444/groups))
   2. Select the **Compulsory Assignment 1 - Sample** tab and find to which group you have been (randomly) assigned.
   3. Each group is named  **Compulsory Assignment 1 - Sample *k***, where *k* is a number from 1 to 20 mapping to the sample names as follows:

| k  | Sample name | k  | Sample name |
|----|-------------|----|-------------|
| 1  | balbc_3_0   | 11 | balbc_10_0   |
| 2  | balbc_3_1   | 12 | balbc_10_1   |
| 3  | balbc_3_2   | 13 | balbc_10_2   |
| 4  | balbc_3_3   | 14 | balbc_10_4   |
| 5  | balbc_3_4   | 15 | balbc_10_5   |
| 6  | balbc_6_0   | 16 | balbc_12_1   |
| 7  | balbc_6_1   | 17 | balbc_12_2   |
| 8  | balbc_6_2   | 18 | balbc_12_3   |
| 9  | balbc_6_4   | 19 | balbc_12_4   |
| 10 | balbc_6_5   | 20 | balbc_12_5   |

: Mapping of group labels to sample names {#tbl-groups}



## Tasks

### Show that you understand the BLAST+ package

The BLAST+ package contains five **core blast search programs**. 

1. List all five core blast search programs.
2. Explain the difference between **blastn** and **blastp**.

### Show that you understand the biological experiment and data

Write a short paragraph in your own words to explain the biological experiment that was done to generate the sequence data (see the [publication][1]), what sequences are contained in the **PacBio_VSG_filtered_reads_*sample_name*.fasta** files, and what sequences are contained in the **TREU927-v26_VSGTranscripts** database.

Answer the following question: What is the number of sequences in *your* input file?

**Hint:** Most popular programming languages have packages that can parse FASTA files automatically. 

### BLAST the sample sequences against the reference VSG database

Find the relevant BLAST command on the [longread-application repository][2]. Then adapt this command in the following ways:

1. Change the input file name to *your* assigned sample file (see @tbl-groups).

2. Change the output file name to something containing *your* sample label (see @tbl-groups).

3. What does the paramater `-max_target_seq` do and why was it set to 1?

4. Use a tabular output format *without* comments that includes *only* the following columns:
   - Query sequence id
   - Subject sequence id
   - Raw score
   - Bit score
   - E-value
   - Query sequence length
   - Subject sequence length
   - Alignment length
   - Start of alignment in subject
   - End of alignment in subject
   - Number of identical matches
   - Number of mismatches
   - Total number of gaps
   - Percentage of positive-scoring matches

Include the exact BLAST command you ran in your report.

### Analyze the BLAST output

Answer the following questions / perform the following tasks:

1. What is the number of sequences in *your* blast output file? Is it the same as in the input file?<br>
   **Hint:** Import the blastn output file into a DataFrame.

2. We define the alignment coverage as the percentage of the subject sequence covered by the alignment. Compute the alignment coverage for all sequences from the blastn output.

3. Visualize the distribution of alignment coverages as a histogram.

4. Remove alignments with coverage less than 60% and verify that each query sequence is now aligned to at most one subject sequence.

5.  The bit score $S'$ is derived from the raw score $S$ using the formula
   $$
   S' = \frac{\lambda S - \ln K}{\ln 2}
   $$
   Can you find the values of $\lambda$ and $K$ from your blast results?<br>
   **Hint:** Plot the bit scores against the raw scores.

### Count VSG expression levels


Perform the following tasks:

1. Extract the unique VSG ids in *your* sample from your (filtered) BLAST results.

2. For each unique VSG: count the number of sequences aliging to that VSG, and the average number of identical matches, mismatches, and gaps for its alignments.<br>
   **Hint:** Using the split-apply-combine strategy, these numbers can be computed in one line of code.

3. Identify the 10 most abundant VSGs in *your* sample and visualize their relative expression levels in a pie chart and compare your result against [Figure 3](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007262.g003) of the [paper][1].

4. Write a paragraph in your report that describes the figures and your interpretation of them.

### Identify open reading frames

Perform the following tasks:

1. Find the relevant `getorf` command on the [longread-application repository][2] and adapt it to work on *your* input sample. Include the exact `getorf` command in your report.

2. Count the percentage of reads in *your* sample that result in a predicted ORF with a minimum size of 1200 nucleotides.

3. Which explanation was proposed in the [paper][1] for this low percentage?
