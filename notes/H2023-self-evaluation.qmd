1. MolBio lecture bit boring list of facts.
   - Ask someone with molbio background to teach something more lively
   - Give reading assignment and molbio quiz that must be passed instead of lecture 

2. Need lecture on Unix command line, Pandas (dataframes, split-apply-combine), BioPython/SeqIO before Assignment 1. Can replace RNA-seq lecture.

3. Order modules DNA -> RNA -> protein. 

4. Motif discovery slides (EM, Gibbs sampler) need better structure
   - General idea of cycling between given start sites, update PWM, and given PWM, update start sites
   - Representing starting positions and PWMs
   - Generative model $P(seq \mid PWM, starting pos)$
   - EM
   - Gibbs sampling
